This project developed at the Military College of Signals, NUST, represents a significant step forward in real-time hazard detection. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, we've created a practical and user-friendly application that transforms your laptop into a powerful safety tool.

Key Features of Safety Scout:

Real-time Detection: Utilizes the laptop's camera to accurately detect fire and smoke.
User-Centric Design: Integrates HCI principles to ensure an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.
Cost-Effective Solution: Provides accessible safety features without the need for expensive, specialized equipment.
